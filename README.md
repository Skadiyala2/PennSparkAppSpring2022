# PennSparkAppSpring2022 (NOTE SWITCH TO BRANCH MASTER TO SEE CODE)
1) This is my rendition of "Tweeter". The project was not fully finished (I spent 4-5 hours last night debugging my code, reinstalling NPM, adjusting virtual environment, changing package configurations, only to realize that I accidentally named my Navbar MainNav instead of Navbar :(((( ) My application has a completed front end and a backend side. I just needed to add JSON reading / posting capabilities in the React portion and add JWT authentication in the backend in order to finalize it. (I'm probably going to finish this project on the weekend for fun). In terms of application capabilities, the back end can handle all the functionalities involving automated hashtags, tweets, user creation, follow, etc. and set up a REST framework, and the front end uses components and is mobile friendly. 


2) I chose to make my application mobile friendly, include components, make API calls, integrate with SQL Lite database, and integrate the backend with classes and objects.

3) If I'm being honest, I probably spent around 20-30 hours. That time consisted a lot about learning about Django's REST Framework and learning about making JSON requests and calls from React because I have a good amount of experience with both React and Django, but I used them mostly seperately. Learning how to integrate them did take me a bit of time.

4) Since my project isn't completely functional, I recorded the Django administration screen to show my back end's capabilities and showed the web pages I built in REACT.
